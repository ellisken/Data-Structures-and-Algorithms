# Quicksort

## Explanation 
Quick sort partitions an array and recursively moves all elements smaller than the selected pivot point value to the left subarray and all larger elements to the right subarray before moving the pivot value to its rightful, sorted position.

## Big O
Time Complexity: Worst case is O(n^2) (this is the case when the array is already sorted in descending order). Average case is O(nlogn).
Space Complexity: O(h) (height of the stack)
